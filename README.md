# Xenoverse
Project for Web App Development

Xenoverse Gaming is a general gaming hub for all gamers alike. Visitors to the site can browse what games are in possession of the organization and what tournaments are being held. Signed in users are able to give feedback on their experiences at the physical location, which will be taken into consideration to make the experience for everyone better. They will also be able to register for any available tournaments. Admins of the website will be able to use their admin page to keep track of how many users there are, tournaments they have registered for, and the feedback that is submitted.

The website was developed by Willee Jordan.
